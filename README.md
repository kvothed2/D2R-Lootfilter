# D2R-Lootfilter
This is my basic D2R lootfilter.

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY OFFLINE LOOT FILTER, YOU CANNOT USE IT ONLINE.

In order to use it follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have 30 Gigs free since you will be extracting the Diablo II Resurrected data to edit.
2. Download CascView
  - Website: http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html
  - Download: http://www.zezula.net/download/cascview_en.zip
3. Open CascView (Use default config)
4. Click Open Storage (Top left corner)
5. Navigate to Diablo II Resurrected Data Folder "Diablo II Resurrected\Data"
6. Select the Data Folder.
7. Inside CascView Navigate to Data\Data
8. Highlight all three folders: global, hd, local
9. Extract to: Diablo II Resurrected\Data (This will take awhile).
10. Diablo II Resurrected\Data should now have the following folders:
-config, data, global, hd, indices, local

To Add Loot Filter:
1. Navigate to: Diablo II Resurrected\Data\local\lng\strings 
2. Paste the attached files and replace existing ones (make a copy of the originals just in case)
3. Create a shortcut for the game, add the following parameters in the properties. Launch the game from the shortcut.
